# Libreries Global Menu KDE

**What is this?**

These libraries allow you to have a little more compatibility with the global menu of KDE PLASMA, by this I mean ELECTRON applications, VS Code, among others they are not activated in this global menu in some Linux distributions, so in this repository you will find the way to install them.



### Arch Linux and its derivatives

I want to mention right now that all are downloaded from the AUR, so if you do not have yay or pamac, I leave you this link so that you can download them.
